				<h1>Project Analysis</h1>
				<h2>Truffles and Trifles Redesign</h2>
				
			</header>	
				
			<section>
				<h2>Site Intent:</h2>
				<p>The site Truffles and Trifles at first glance gets the intended point across as a informational site for 
				cooking classes and fresh baked pastries in the Orlando area. It will be the intent of this redesign to give 
				the site a new fresh more streamline look as well as approach to mobile first design. Applying a responsive 
				aspect to the site will give site users who are using any type of search medium, from smart phones to tablets 
				and so on, the right look and usability that their operating system complies with. That way the site will 
				reach across the board to help user flow and keep interest in what Truffles and Trifles has to offer.</p>
				
				<h2>Competitive Analysis:</h2>
				<p>When searching the competing market for cooking classes on sites such as Yelp.com and Alexa.com it becomes 
				clear that Truffles and Trifles offers a less academic type of class. Which is in a realm of its own market 
				wise, offering more casual lessons not to be confused with any less of a learning experience but more geared 
				toward person’s who are looking to improve the cooking at home. All the other sites found are geared to a 
				more academic professional career in cooking. This can be used to our advantage when redesigning Truffles 
				and Trifles as they offer a unique approach to this type of learning demographic.</p>
				
				<p>Competitor Analysis shows the sites keyword focus should stick to cooking lessons rather than cooking 
				classes as to lead the user to understand the casual nature of the classes. Another thing that will help keep 
				user interest and speaks for itself is creating links to the reviews written on sites such as Yelp and 
				Angie’s List. This will help with the only thing I found as a bad review on Truffles and Trifles being 
				confused as more school oriented and really just for a demographic that wants to be a better cook at home and 
				is interested in gourmet foods and gifts. This will boost sales in not only cooking lessons but also the other 
				goods that are offered by Truffles and Trifles giving a great return on this sites remodel investment.</p>
				
				<h2>Targeted Audience:</h2>
				<p>The Targeted Audience will stick to two types as to narrow the sites over wording of whom they are and what 
				they have to offer. The main target will be the casual student who wants to improve his/her culinary skills 
				and the second target will be a consumer of baked goods and gourmet food gifts. This will reduce the sites 
				bloated wording and overall site system giving a fresh new approach that other competitors in this market have 
				obtained.</p>
